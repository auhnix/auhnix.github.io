right now, it is late-night, the day ahead of a Huge Presentation i have for my senior project. it's been, uh, a year+ since i last updated this place. it only took a pandemic and an election cycle to drive me back here!

there is something bizarre about having this whole corner of the internet to 'myself' - if one can ever really call it that - this naive anonymity that i keep while staying in my room for the eighth day in a row. something  within me has been grappling for months with whether or not i should suck it up and start putting the good ol' fingers to the keyboard. part of me os afraid that i'll forget the off-the-wall thoughts i have now, and that i haven't written anything leisurely in ... years? and the notion of having a 'blog' that just sounds like regurgitated academia is a painful one (almost as painful as the admission that, as shia labeouf of cannibalism fame once said, I Must Simply Do It.)

but finally quarantine months have forced my hand; i am getting a little tired of rambling to my friends. and, besides, there's some kind of glamor in seeing everything i've created all put together in one place. something that i actually assembled on my own time. and, to be fair, what the hell else am i going to do with my time?

so, with any luck, the landscaping isn't the only thing here that will change. ha. maybe if i start speaking as if people are listening, i'll be less :woozy: about the rare occasions when they are.
