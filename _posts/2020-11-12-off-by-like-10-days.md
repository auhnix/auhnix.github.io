"kyoto" stands tall as one of only two easily-billed "indie rock" songs in phoebe bridgers' discography (the other being "motion sickness," from her debut). in the leadup to *punisher*'s release, and the comedown from its assimilation into the indie/folk rock scene, the community's reception of "kyoto" has fluctuated. (such is, i suppose, the fate of any lead indie/alt single that's more palatable than its record.)
