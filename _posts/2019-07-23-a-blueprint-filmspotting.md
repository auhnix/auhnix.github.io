hello blog. how're you doing?

today marks a month until i get back to school, and i've decided something monumental: it is, at last, time to get through the movies i've been stockpiling for YEARS. for all the random pieces of media i've consumed, as i get older, i realize just how many things i wasn't fully awake/cognizant for. hopefully i'll fix that in the remaining time i have.

i'll possibly write up thoughts about things as i go; we will see. inb4 this just absolutely wrecks my critical opinions of things i love. chances are that i end up harping on brat pack movies all summer instead of getting through any of the list below, but you know. life, uh, finds a way.

## films, in no particular order:

<ul>
	<li><span class="mtitle">a clockwork orange <span class="mdesc">(1971, dir. stanley kubrick)</span></span> last time i watched this was after i soberly endured an especially annoying collegiate rager. i fell asleep halfway through, exhausted from babysitting college students five years older than myself. i figure i should revisit.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">eternal sunshine of the spotless mind <span class="mdesc">(2004, dir. michael gondry)</span></span> because every movie list on the internet lists this as a must-see modern classic. also, i'm very excited to see jim carrey in a non-slapstick role. to a lesser extent, i'm hyped for watching kate winslet play a contemporary character.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">good will hunting <span class="mdesc">(1997, dir. gus van sant)</span></span> just wanted an excuse to rewatch.</li>
	<li><span class="mtitle">stand by me <span class="mdesc">(1986, dir. rob reiner)</span></span> a movie that i used to watch all the time and felt weirdly tied to because wil wheaton hails from my mom's hometown.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">donnie darko <span class="mdesc">(2001, dir. richard kelly)</span></span> my best friend when i was 13 told me i HAD to watch this, and when i kept forgetting to, she relented and made me listen to echo and the bunnymen's "the killing moon" (one of the movie's two signature songs) many more times than i ever wanted to.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">reality bites <span class="mdesc">(1994, dir. ben stiller)</span></span> one of my mom's favorites. here because winona ryder, but also because its credits song ("stay" by lisa loeb) is another favorite of my mother's and was reportedly an obsession of mine as a child. basically, this has a lot of significance for me, especially for a movie that i've never actually seen.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">the grand budapest hotel <span class="mdesc">(2014, dir. wes anderson)</span></span> wes anderson. watched this when i'd come down with this horrific fever, in between episodes of bbc sherlock.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">cinema paradiso <span class="mdesc">(1988, dir. giuseppe tornatore)</span></span> provides some nice foreign film flavor (or, as i call it, *fff*). my mom won't shut up about this one.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">sixteen candles <span class="mdesc">(1984, dir. john hughes)</span></span> the only brat pack movie that i don't know by heart. the buck stops here.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">little miss sunshine <span class="mdesc">(2006, dir. valerie faris/jonathan dayton)</span></span> saw this years and years ago and remember it far more vividly than the many other movies i watched at the time (many of which have ended up on this list). baby abigail breslin and the weird campiness that i've come to love in Cinema&trade;.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">500 days of summer <span class="mdesc">(2009, dir. marc webb)</span></span> another one that i'd been wanting to rewatch.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">fight club <span class="mdesc">(1999, dir. david fincher)</span></span> because somehow i haven't already seen/read this?</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">dancer in the dark <span class="mdesc">(2000, dir. lars von trier)</span></span> bjork.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">ruby sparks <span class="mdesc">(2012, dir. valerie faris/jonathan dayton)</span></span> same directorial team as <em>little miss sunshine</em>! anyway - tumblr of a few years ago was obsessed with this one's meta-ness and commentary on the manic pixie dream girl stereotype and all that. also, i have a soft spot for zoe kazan after a roommate i had a strenuous friendship with forced me to watch <em>the big sick</em> for her birthday.</li>

	<li><span class="mtitle">roma <span class="mdesc">(2018, dir. alfonso cuar√≥n)</span></span> meant to watch it right when it was picking up popularity/acclaim, forgot as i always do, etc. etc.</li>
</ul>
