today marks a month until i get back to school, and i'm trying to force myself to get through the movie and album lists i wrote ages ago. for all the random pieces of media i've consumed, as i get older, i realize just how many things i wasn't fully awake/cognizant for. hopefully i'll fix that in the remaining time i have.

i'll possibly write up thoughts about things as i go; we will see.

## films, in no particular order:
- **a clockwork orange**

last time i watched this was after i soberly endured an especially annoying collegiate rager. i fell asleep halfway through, exhausted from babysitting college students five years older than myself. i figure i should revisit.

- **eternal sunshine of the spotless mind**

because every movie list on the internet lists this as a must-see modern classic. also, i'm very excited to see jim carrey in a non-slapstick role. to a lesser extent, i'm hyped for watching kate winslet play a contemporary character.

- **donnie darko**

my best friend when i was 13 told me i HAD to watch this, and when i kept forgetting to, she relented and made me listen to echo and the bunnymen's "the killing moon" off of the movie's soundtrack many more times than i ever wanted to.


- **stand by me**
a movie that i used to watch all the time and felt weirdly tied to because wil wheaton hails from my mom's hometown.

- **reality bites**

one of my mom's favorites. here because winona ryder, but also because its credits song ("stay" by lisa loeb) is another favorite of my mother's and was reportedly an obsession of mine as a child. basically, this has a lot of significance for me, especially for a movie that i've never actually seen.

- **grand budapest hotel**

wes anderson. watched this when i was 

- **pulp fiction**

i've somehow evaded watching this in full, though i've seen the scene where uma thurman's character gets shot up with adrenaline no fewer than six times.

- **cinema paradiso**

my mom won't shut up about this one. also, provides some nice foreign film flavor (or, as i call it, *fff*).

- **good will hunting**

just wanted an excuse to rewatch this one.

- **fight club**
don't know how i've escaped watching this AND reading its source material!
- **dancer in the dark**
bjork.
- **ruby sparks**
tumblr of a few years ago was obsessed with this one's meta-ness and commentary on the manic pixie dream girl stereotype and all that. also, i have a soft spot for zoe kazan after a roommate i had a strenuous friendship with forced me to watch *the big sick* for her birthday.
- **500 days of summer**
zooey deschanel.
- **little miss sunshine**
saw this years and years ago and remember it far more vividly than the many other movies i watched at the time (many of which have ended up on this list). baby abigail breslin and the weird campiness that i've come to love in Cinema&trade;
- **sixteen candles**
this remains the only john hughes movie that i consistently mix up with his other works. the buck stops here.
- **roma**
meant to watch it right when it was picking up popularity/acclaim, forgot as i always do, etc. etc.
